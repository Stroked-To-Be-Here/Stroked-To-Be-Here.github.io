        <h2>About Ella Ferguson</h2>
        <p><strong>Ella Ferguson</strong> is a 30-year-old Atlanta native with a
            story of resilience, creativity, and determination. In 2021, she
            suffered a life-altering AVM stroke, leading to a severe brain
            hemorrhage. Thanks to emergency surgery and her indomitable spirit,
            Ella began an inspiring journey of recovery.</p>

        <h3>Rediscovering Her Passions</h3>
        <p>As she continues to recover, Ella is reconnecting with her passions for
            art and music. Before her stroke, she was known for her creativity, both
            as a visual artist and a musician. She plays multiple instruments,
            including guitar, mandolin, and fiddle. While she works to regain full
            use of her left hand, Ella has started drawing and painting again,
            expressing her journey and resilience through her art.</p>

        <h3>A Path Back to Art Education</h3>
        <p>Ella was partway through her degree in art education at Georgia State
            University when her stroke happened. Her goal now is to complete that
            journey and become an art teacher, inspiring others with her story and
            her art. This pursuit is about sharing her experience, raising
            awareness, and giving back to her community.</p>
