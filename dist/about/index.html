    <h2>About Ella Ferguson</h2>

    <p><strong>Ella Ferguson</strong> is a 30-year-old Atlanta native with a story of resilience, creativity, and determination. In 2021, she suffered a life-altering AVM (arteriovenous malformation) stroke, a rare congenital condition that led to a severe brain hemorrhage. This incident occurred suddenly while Ella was with loved ones after her cousin's memorial service. Within hours, she was airlifted to Emory Hospital, where she underwent emergency surgery to save her life.</p>

    <p>Since that day, Ella has faced numerous physical and emotional challenges. The stroke left her paralyzed on her left side, affecting her mobility, coordination, and daily independence. Yet, Ella has defied expectations at every turn, pushing herself through months of intense rehabilitation. Her progress has been nothing short of remarkable: she has regained partial movement, improved her coordination, and remains determined to reclaim her independence fully.</p>

    <h3>Rediscovering Her Passions</h3>
    <p>As she continues to recover, Ella is reconnecting with her passions for art and music. Before her stroke, she was known for her creativity, both as a visual artist and a musician. She plays multiple instruments, including guitar, mandolin, and fiddle. While she still works to regain full use of her left hand, Ella has started drawing and painting again, expressing her journey and resilience through her art. Her family, who have deep roots in Atlanta’s East Atlanta Village, have been pillars of support, drawing on their shared love of music and creativity to encourage her along the way.</p>

    <h3>A Path Back to Art Education</h3>
    <p>Ella was partway through her degree in art education at Georgia State University when her stroke happened. Her goal now is to complete that journey and become an art teacher, inspiring others with her story and her art. For Ella, this pursuit is about more than personal achievement—it’s about sharing her experience, raising awareness about stroke recovery, and giving back to her community.</p>

    <h3>Supporting Ella’s Journey</h3>
    <p>Through <strong>Stroked to Be Here</strong>, Ella and her care team aim to raise awareness about the impact of sudden strokes, share effective treatments, and provide insights into her recovery journey. While her rehabilitation is ongoing, it’s limited by insurance and resources. Community support is essential to help her access the advanced physical, occupational, and speech therapy she needs. Every donation, word of encouragement, and act of support brings her closer to walking independently and regaining the use of her left arm and hand.</p>

With your help, she can continue to make strides in her recovery, rediscover her passions, and one day achieve her goal of teaching and inspiring others.
