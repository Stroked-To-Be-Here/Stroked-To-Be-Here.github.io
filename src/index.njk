        <h2>On June 9th, 2020, 26-year-old Ella Jane Ferguson suffered a hemorrhagic stroke, leaving her in a coma and near death.</h2>
        <p>Dramatic medical intervention saved her life but left her paralyzed on the left side of her body. Even though the recovery journey has been long and hard, Ella has made remarkable progress. 
        <p><b>In her first year of recovery</b>, she regained the ability to walk.</p>
        <p><b>In her second year</b>, she regained the ability to shower independently and carry on conversations.</p>
        <p><b>In her third year</b>, she has regained sensation & some gross motor control in her left arm.</p>
        <p><b>Who knows what her fourth year of recovery will bring?</b> But to continue healing, she needs our help and support.</p>
